The work has been finished. 
I optimized some image processing algorithms and logics of Zxing. It works greatly and uses few memory.
After my optimization, QR code can be decoded in 50ms and 1D barcode can be decoded in 20~30ms on Spreadtrum SC6531 board (ARM9 200MHz).
Because of some reasons, I can not open the source right now. Maybe in the future, I would release the code.
